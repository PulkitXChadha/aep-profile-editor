## Installation

### Prerequisites

> To deploy and use this app you will need to provision Project Firefly on your Adobe Account. Follow the link for details on [How to Get Access to Project Firefly](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/project-firefly/docs.html#!AdobeDocs/project-firefly/master/overview/getting_access.md)

> Before you get started please ensure that you have all prerequisites on my workstation. Follow the link for details on how to [Setting up Your Environment](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/project-firefly/docs.html#!AdobeDocs/project-firefly/master/getting_started/setup.md)

### Create Product Profile

Access to all project Firefly apps is managed through [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com). The recommended approach to managing access to the app using User Groups that have privileged Product Profiles. Follow the instructions below to set this up:

1. Create a user group with an appropriate name and description. Click `Save` when ready.

   ![Admin Create user Group](images/admin-create-user-group.png)

2. Create Adobe Experience Platform Product Profiles to manage privileges for the app workspaces. group with an appropriate name and description.

   - Go to Adobe Experience Platform Product in Admin console and click `New Profile`.
     ![Admin AEP Product Switcher](images/admin-aep-product.png)

   - Give the Profile an appropriate name and description and click `Next` when ready.
     ![Admin AEP Product Profile Name](images/admin-aep-product-profile-name.png)

   - No Additonal Services need to be selected for this application.
     ![Admin AEP Product Profile Services](images/admin-aep-product-profile-services.png)

   - The app at least needs the following roles:

     - `View Schemas`
     - `View Datasets`
     - `View Profiles`
     - `Manage Profiles`
     - `View Identity Namespaces`
     - `View Sandboxes`
     - `View Sources`

   - Once all roles have been selected click `Save` when ready.

3. Add Teh User Group to the Product Profile

   ![Admin AEP Product Profile Name](images/admin-aep-product-profile-user-group.png)

### Creating a new Project in Adobe Developer Console

Adobe Developer Console gives you access to APIs, SDKs, and developer tools to build on, integrate, and extend Adobe products. This app needs access to Adobe I/O Runtime credentials and access to Adobe Experience Platform APIs. Follow the instructions to set up your project:

1. Navigate to [Adobe Developer Console](https://console.adobe.io/).

2. Use the Org Switcher on the upper right corner to ensure or to select the Org you want to use.
   ![Org Switcher](images/console-home.png)

3. Once you are in the correct organization, Under `Quick Start`, click on the option to `Create project from template`.
   **Note that if you don't this option, it might be because your request to access Project Firefly has not yet been approved.**

4. Select `Project Firefly` from the list of templates.
   ![](images/console-project-template.png)

5. Enter `Project Title` and `App Name` for your templated project.

   - `Project Title` Give a descriptive title to e.e "**AEP Profile Editor \<\<company name\>\>**"
   - `App Name` Please enter "**aepProfileEditor**". This should match the project name in `package.json`

   - Click `Save` when ready.
     ![](images/console-project-details.png)

6. You should see a new project has 2 default `Workspaces`. It is recommended to create workspaces for individual developers working on a project.

   - Create a new workspace by clicking the `+ Add workspace` button. Give the workspace an appropriate name and description.

   - Click `Save` when ready.

     ![](images/console-add-workspace.png)

7. Within each of the workspace you will need to add the service needed for the app.

   - Click the `+ Add service` button and select `API`
     ![](images/console-workspace-api.png)

   - Click on `Adobe Experience Platform` then select the `Experience Platform API` tile, click `Next ` when ready.
     ![](images/console-workspace-api-aep.png)

   - Select `Generate a new key pair` or upload a key pair you have already, click `Next ` when ready.
     ![](images/console-workspace-api-aep-keys.png)

   - Select the product profile created for in preview sets and click `Save configured API`.
     ![](images/console-workspace-api-aep-profile.png)

### Install Project Locally

1. On your machine, navigate to the Terminal and enter

   ```
   $ aio login
   ```

   This will open a browser window where you will need to enter your Adobe ID.
   ![](images/aio-login.png)

2. Clone the github repo

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/PulkitXChadha/aep-profile-editor.git
   ```

   ![](images/git-clone.png)

3. Change directory

   ```
   $ cd aep-profile-editor
   ```

4. Select the Organization, Project and workspace. the AIO CLI has helper commands to allow you to efficiently select the workspaces and have the app use the credentials associated with the workspace. The credentials included the `.aio`, `.env` and `config.json` files. You will need to run the following commands:

   - List all organizations you have access to `aio console org list`
   - Select the org you want to use `aio console org select <<IMS ORG>>`
   - List all Projects in the org `aio console project list`
   - Select the Project you want to use `aio console project select <<Project ID>>`
   - List all workspaces in the project `aio console workspace list`
   - Select the workspace you want to use `aio console workspace select <<workspace ID>>`
     ![](images/aio-org-project-workspace.png)

5. From within the project folder run the following command to downloads the relevant configuration files.

   ```
   $ aio app use
   ```

   ![](images/aio-app-use.png)

   This step will create `.aio`, `.env` and `config.json` files which include the credentials needed to run the app in the workspace.
   You can manually populate the `.env` file in the project root and fill it as shown [below](#env).

6. Install all node dependency libraries.From within the project folder run the following command

   ```
   $ npm install
   ```

7. Run locally (this step needs docker and docker images, see details in the [above](#prerequisites)). Ensure that Docker is running on you machine and run the following command:

   ```
   $ aio app:run --local
   ```

   > This step might that a few mins at first.

   > you might need to accept a self-signed certificate to use `https://localhost:9080`
   > When successful you should see the below message.
   > ![](images/aio-app-run-local.png)

8. Copy and paste the URL `https://experience.adobe.com/?devMode=true#/custom-apps/?localDevUrl=https://localhost:9080` in a browser and you should see the app screen.
   ![](images/app-screen-local.png)

### Test & Coverage

- The project has > 150 unit tests for each of the UI and runtime actions. You can run these test by running the following command from the project folder

  ```
  $ npm run test
  ```

- To Run a test coverage report run the following command from the project folder
  ```
  $ npm run test-coverage
  ```

### Deploy & Cleanup

- `aio app deploy` to build and deploy all actions on Runtime and static files to CDN
- `aio app undeploy` to undeploy the app

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

The repo uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The `.github/workflows` folder has all the workflows yml files used.

> You may need to modify and/or delete some of these workflow files.

For more information [CI/CD for Project Firefly Applications](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/project-firefly/docs.html#!AdobeDocs/project-firefly/master/guides/ci_cd_for_firefly_apps.md)
